/*
This demonstrates how to make actions using rot vel and how to use them.
It creates two actions, Go and Turn... Go will drive the robot forward safely,
while Turn will avoid obstacles by turning.

Each of these actions have the normal constructor and destructor, note that 
the constructors use constructor chaining to create their ArAction part
correctly.  Each action then also implements the needed fire function, this
fire function is where the robot is driven from.  

Also note that each of these actions override the setRobot function, their
implementation grabs the sonar device from the robot in addition to doing the
needed caching of the robot pointer.  This is what you should do if you
care about the presence or absence of a particular sensor.  If you don't
care about any particular sensor you could just use one of the 
ArRobot::checkRangeDevice functions (there are four of them).

Also note that these are very naive actions, they are simply an example
of how to use actions.
