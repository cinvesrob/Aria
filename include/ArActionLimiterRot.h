/// Action to limit the forwards motion of the robot based on range sensor readings
/**
   This action uses the robot's range sensors (e.g. sonar, laser) to find a 
   maximum speed at which to travel
   and will increase the deceleration so that the robot doesn't hit
   anything.  If it has to, it will trigger an estop to avoid a
   collision.

   Note that this cranks up the deceleration with a strong strength,
   but it checks to see if there is already something decelerating
   more strongly... so you can put these actions lower in the priority list so
   things will play together nicely.
