/// Keep track of recent sonar readings from a robot as an ArRangeDevice
/** 
    This class is for keeping a sonar history, which you may use for obstacle 
    avoidance, display, etc.
    Simply use ArRobot::addRangeDevice()  (or ArSonarDevice::setRobot())
    to attach an ArSonarDevice object to an ArRobot
    robot object; ArSonarDevice will add a Sensor Interpretation task to the
    ArRobot which will read new sonar readings each robot cycle and add
    them to its sonar history.

    (Note that sonar range readings are from the surface of the sonar transducer disc,
    not from the center of the robot.)
