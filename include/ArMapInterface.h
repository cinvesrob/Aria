 *  \brief Contains the set of interfaces that define the Aria maps.
 *  \date 06/27/08
 *  \author K. Cunningham
 * 
 * The methods that define the Aria maps are grouped into a set of smaller
 * interfaces which are contained in this file.   These include:
 * 
 *  - ArMapScanInterface : Methods related to scan data (e.g.  points and
 *    lines) generally obtained from a specific sensor (such as the SICK laser
 *    or Hokuyo URG).
 *
 *  - ArMapObjectsInterface : Methods related to the objects in a map.
 *    These include user-defined objects such as goals, docks, and forbidden
 *    lines.  They also include special "data" types of objects that may be
 *    automatically created during the scanning process.
 * 
 *  - ArMapInfoInterface : Methods related to the various info arguments
 *    stored in a map.  Examples of info include the map object type 
 *    definitions and the routes and macros.
 * 
 *  - ArMapSupplementInterface : Methods used to access supplemental data 
 *    associated with the map.  This currently consists only of the latitude /
 *    longitude of the origin, but may be extended in the future.
 * 
 * The primary interface implemented by all Aria maps is also contained in
 * this file:
 *
 *  - ArMapInterface : All of the methods that are available for an Aria map.
 *    This interface extends all of the above interfaces and contains a 
 *    few additional file-related methods.
 * 
 * In general, when passing an Aria map (pointer) as a parameter to a method, 
 * it is preferable to pass ArMapInterface *.  This will allow for extension 
 * and different implementations of the interface.

/**
 * ArMapInterface defines the methods that are available on all Aria maps.
 * These maps represent the operating space of a robot, and can be used for
 * space searching, localizing, navigating etc.  The types of data stored 
 * in a map include sensable obstacles (e.g. walls and furniture in a room)
 * represented either as a collection of data points (similar to a raster 
 * or bit map, useful for high resolution sensors like a laser), or lines 
 * (a vector map, useful for low resolution sensors like the sonar), 
 * goals, and other points or regions of interest ("map objects"). 
 * 
 * The methods in ArMapInterface can be broadly categorized as follows:
 *   - Scan Methods:  These provide access the sensable obstacles that are
 *     represented as a collection of data points or lines.  These are 
 *     typically generated during the scanning process (i.e. the creation of 
 *     the .2d file).  If more than one sensor is used, then the data is
 *     organized on a per-sensor basis.  The scan methods are grouped into 
 *     the ArMapScanInterface.  
 *   - Object Methods:  These provide access to the "high-level" objects 
 *     in the environment.  Such objects include goals, docks, forbidden 
 *     areas, and other user-defined points of interest.  They may also 
 *     include special data objects that are actually part of the operating
 *     environment and are generally added automatically and are not editable
 *     by the user.  The object methods are grouped into the 
 *     ArMapObjectsInterface.
 *   - Info Methods: A wide variety of supporting information is included 
 *     in various "info" categories.  This includes definitions for the 
 *     types of map objects that can be stored in the map.  It also includes
 *     various optional features such as macros and schedules.  The info
 *     methods are grouped into the ArMapInfoInterface.
 *   - Extra Data Methods: These are essentially the "leftovers" -- i.e. 
 *     methods that are related directly to map data but which do not 
 *     fit into any of the above categories.  They are defined in the 
 *     ArMapSupplementInterface.
 *   - Callback Methods:  Users of the Aria map may install callbacks onto
 *     the map in order to be notified when the map contents has changed.
 *     These methods are defined below.
 *   - File and I/O Methods: Methods to read and write map files are also
 *     included below.  In addition, the MD5 checksum of the map contents
 *     may be calculated.
 *
 * TODO: 
 *  - Possibly make the calculation of checksums optional?
