/*
  This demo starts up the robot in its own thread, then runs a bunch of the 
  direct motion commands... note that if you want to stop direct motion 
  commands and let actions take over, you should use clearDirectMotion, see
  the docs for details.  Also note how it locks the robot before doing anything
  with the robot, then unlocks it when done, this is vital for threaded code.
  You shouldn't really use threads if you don't understand them or don't need
  them.

/*
  This is a connection handler, fairly simple, but quite useful, esp when
  the robot is running in another thread.  Its not really needed here
  since blockingConnect is used.  But it'd still be useful if there is an
  error after connected
