/** @brief Talk to a compass directly over a computer serial port
 *  
 *  This class configures and recieves compass heading data from a TCM2 or TCM2.5 compass
 *  directly over a computer serial port, rather than via tha robot.
 *  This class cannot recieve pitch, roll or temperature data from the compass.
 *  On all Pioneer robots, the TCM compass (as originally installed by
 *  MobileRobots) is connected to the robot microcontroller, so if you 
 *  have a Pioneer with this configuration, you  should instead use the 
 *  ArTCMCompassRobot class. Only use this class if you
 *  have connected the compass to the computer serial port.
 *
 *  You can create an instance of this class directly, or using an
 *  ArCompassConnector object and giving the "-compassType serialtcm" program
 *  argument. 
 *
 *  If you create your own ArTCMCompassDirect object, you must call the read()
 *  method periodically (ideally at the same rate the compass sends data,
 *  approx. 8 hz by default) to read and parse incoming data. You can use an
 *  ArRobot callback to do this, for example:
 *  @code
 *    ArRetFunctor1C<int, ArTCMCompassDirect, unsigned int> compassReadFunc(myCompass, &ArTCMCompassDirect::read, 10);
 *    myRobot->addSensorInterpTask("ArTCMCompassDirect read", 200, &compassReadFunc);
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  If you use ArCompassConnector, however, it will automatically do this.
 *
