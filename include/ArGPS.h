/** @brief GPS Device Interface 
 *
 *  Connects to GPS device over a serial port or other device connection and reads data.
 *  Supports GPS devices sending standard NMEA format data 
 *  (specifically the GPRMC, GPGGA, GPGSA, GPGRME, and optionally GPGSV, PGRMZ, PGRME, 
 *  HCHDG/T/M and GPHDG/T/M messages). 
 *  If your GPS device supports several data formats or modes, select
 *  NMEA output in its configuration.
 *
 *  The preferred method of creating and setting up a new ArGPS object is to use
 *  ArGPSConnector, which creates an instance of ArGPS or a subclass, and
 *  creates and opens its device connection, based on command-line parameters.
 *  (To manually create an ArGPS object, create an ArDeviceConnection instance
 *  and call setDeviceConnection(), then open that device connection and call
 *  connect().
 *
 *  For either method, to get new data from the GPS, must call read() or readWithLock() periodically, 
 *  ideally at a rate equal to or faster than your GPS sends data (usually one second). 
 *  You can do this from a Sensor Intetrpretation Task in ArRobot, or a seperate thread. 
 *  If you are calling read() from a loop in a new thread, 
 *
 *  Here is an example of calling readWithLock() from a sensor interpretation
 *  task. The integer argument given to the functor constructor is a milisecond timeout that
 *  is passed to readWithLock() and prevents it from blocking too long if it doesn't read any data.
 *  It is important to do this in a robot task, or the robot task cycle will be
 *  blocked and cause problems.
 *  @code
 *    ArRetFunctor1C<ArGPS, int, unsigned int> gpsReadFunc(myGPS, &ArGPS::readWithLock, 10);
 *    myRobot->addSensorInterpretationTask("GPS read", 100, &gpsReadFunc);
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  If you use your own loop or thread, then it ought to include a call to ArUtil::sleep() for at least several hundred 
 *  miliseconds to avoid starving other threads, since read() will return
 *  immediately if there is no data to read rather than blocking.
 *
 *  For each piece of data provided by this class, there is a flag indicating
 *  whether it was received from the GPS and set. Not all GPS models return all
 *  kinds of information, or it may be disabled in some way in a GPS's internal
 *  configuration, or the GPS may not yet have started sending the data (e.g.
 *  still acquiring satellites).  Also, not all data will be received by one call to read(),
 *  and especially immediately after connecting and starting to read data, it 
 *  may take a few seconds for data to be obtained. Furthermore, it may take
 *  some time for the GPS to calculate data with full accuracy.
 *
 *  @sa @ref gpsExample.cpp
 *  @sa @ref gpsRobotTaskExample.cpp
 *
 *  This class is not inherently thread safe. Stored data is updated by read(), so 
 *  if accessing from multiple threads, call lock() before calling any data
 *  accessor methods (methods starting with "get"), or read(), and call unlock() 
 *  when done.   You can also call readWithLock() to do a locked read in one
 *  function call. 
 *
 *  @note ArGPS only provides access to the data reported by a GPS. The position
 *  reported by a GPS is in degrees on the surface of the earth (WGS84 datum), not in the
 *  cartesian coordinate system used by the robot odometry or ArMap. You can use 
 *  the subclasses of Ar3DPoint (ArLLACoords, etc) to convert between different
 *  geographical coordinate systems, which may help you match GPS coordinates to
 *  the robot pose coordinate system.
