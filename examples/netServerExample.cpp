/** @example netServerExample.cpp Shows how to use ArNetServer, a simple text
 * command receiver
 */

// To use the net server, start this program, then use the 'telnet' program to connect to localhost
// on TCP port 7171 by running this command:
//   telnet localhost 7171
// When connected and prompted for a password, type in:
//   password
// and press enter.  Then you can enter a command. Use the 'help' command to print available commands.
// For this program, try "test" and "test2" with and without additional arguments.
// ArNetServer is a simple way to provide a quick remote control interface for a robot control 
// program running on the robot's onboard computer over wireless networking, if you don't want to 
// use the ArNetworking library and MobileEyes. (You can provide both options in a program however, 
// ArNetworking and ArNetServer use different TCP ports and will both run fine in the same program.)

// This function just prints out what the client entered and then sends some 
// data back. You could modify it to, for example, control the robot with
// different commands.
void test(char **argv, int argc, ArSocket *socket)
{
  int i;
  printf("Client said: ");
  for (i = 0; i < argc; ++i)
    printf("\t%s\n", argv[i]);
  printf("\n");
  socket->writeString("Thank you, command received.");
}

  // Initialize Aria
  Aria::init();
  // we need a server
  ArNetServer server;
  // a callback for our test function
  ArGlobalFunctor3<char **, int, ArSocket *> testCB(&test);

  // start the server up without a robot on port 7171 with a password
  // of password and allow multiple clients

  // add our test command
