/** Interface to a TCM 2/2.5/2.6 3-axis compass through the robot microcontroller.
 *  When a Pioneer robot is equipped with a TCM compass, it is typically connected
 *  to the robot microcontroller, which returns compass information in 
 *  compass data packets upon request (set compass mode/type to 2 or 3 in
 *  firmware configuration; mode 1 (data in SIP) is not supported by ARIA).  This class communicates
 *  with the robot microcontroller to configure the compass and recieve data
 *  from it.
