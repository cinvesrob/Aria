/// Interface to access and modify a specified zip file.
/**
 * ArZippable is an abstract base class that defines the methods to add
 * and extract files from a zip file.
 * 
 * An ArZippable is expected to be used in a rather "atomic" manner.  It can
 * be opened in one of two modes (ZIP_MODE or UNZIP_MODE), and the available 
 * operations are subsequently restricted based on the mode:  
 * <ul>
 * <li>ZIP_MODE: addAll() and addFile()</li>
 * <li>UNZIP_MODE: getMemberInfoList(), extractAll(), and extractFile()</li>
 * </ul>
 * After the files are added to or extracted from the zip file, it should be
 * close()'ed.
 *
