"""
An example program demonstrating how to make and use new actions.

This example program creates two new actions, Go and Turn. Go will drive the robot forward safely,
while Turn will aobstacles detected by the sonar by turning. 
This program also adds a predefined
action from which = Aria() tries to recover from stalls (hit something and 
can't move forward) by backing and turning.

Each of these actions have the normal constructor and destructor, note that 
the constructors also call ArAction.__init__ to call the parent ArAction
constructor.
Each action then also implements the essential method fire(). This fire 
function is called by the action resolver, and returns values that, in 
combination with other actions' desired behavior, determine the driving 
commands sent to the robot.

Also note that each of these actions override the ArAction::setRobot function; these 
implementations obtain the sonar device from the robot in addition to doing the
needed caching of the robot pointer.  This is what you should do if you
care about the presence or absence of a particular sensor.  If you don't
care about any particular sensor you could just use the checkRangeDevice
methods from ArRobot (there are four of them) in your fire() method.
Also note that these are very naive actions, they are simply an example
of how to use actions.

See the Actions section of the Aria reference manual for more details about
actions, and see the Python README.txt for notes on the tricky aspects
of implementing an ArAction or other subclass.

Also, as a general note, remember actions must take a small amount of time to execute, to avoid
delaying the robot synchronization cycle.
