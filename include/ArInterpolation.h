/** 
    This class takes care of storing in readings of position vs time, and then
    interpolating between them to find where the robot was at a particular 
    point in time.  It has two lists, one containing the times, and one 
    containing the positions at those same times (per position), they must be 
    walked through jointly to maintain cohesion.  The new entries are at the
    front of the list, while the old ones are at the back.  
    numberOfReadings and the setNumberOfReadings control the number of entries
    in the list.  If a size is set that is smaller than the current size, then
    the old ones are chopped off.
    
    This class now has a couple of variables for when it allows
    prediction, they're set with setAllowedMSForPrediction and
    setAllowedPercentageForPrediction.  If either is below 0 than they
    are ignored (if both are below 0 it means any prediction is
    allowed, which would be bad).  Previous there was no MS limit, and
    the percentage limit was 50 (and so that is what the default is
    now).
