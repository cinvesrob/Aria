/// Cross-platform mutex wrapper class 
/**
   This class wraps the operating system's mutex functions. It allows mutualy
   exclusive access to a critical section. This is extremely useful for
   multiple threads which want to use the same variable. On Linux, ArMutex simply
   uses the POSIX pthread interface in an object oriented manner. It also
   applies the same concept to Windows using Windows' own abilities to restrict
   access to critical sections. ArMutex also adds additional
  diagnostic/debugging tools such as logging and timing.
 

   @note ArMutex is by default a recursive mutex. This means that a 
      thread is allowed to acquire an additional lock (whether via lock() or tryLock())
      on a locked mutex if that same thread already has the lock. This allows a thread
      to lock a mutex, but not become deadlocked if any functions called while it 
      is locked also attempt to lock the mutex, while still preventing other threads
      from interrupting it.
      If you want a non-recursive mutex, so that multiple attempts by the same thread 
      to lock a mutex to block, supply an argument of 'false' to the constructor.
