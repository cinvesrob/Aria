/**
   This class is a subclass of ArRangeDeviceThreaded meant for any
   planar scanning lasers, like the SICK lasers, Hokoyo URG series
   lasers, etc.  Unlike most base classes this contains the superset
   of everything that may need to be configured on any of the sensors,
   this is so that the configuration and parameter files don't have to
   deal with anything sensor specific.

   To see the different things you can set on a laser, call the
   functions canSetDegrees, canChooseRange, canSetIncrement,
   canChooseIncrement, canChooseUnits, canChooseReflectorBits,
   canSetPowerControlled, canChooseStartBaud, and canChooseAutoBaud to
   see what is available (the help for each of those tells you what
   functions they are associated with, and for each function
   associated with one of those it tells you to see the associated
   function).
