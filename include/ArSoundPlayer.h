/** 
 * @brief This class provides a cross-platform interface for playing short sound samples.
 * (Currently implemented for Windows and Linux).
 * @sa For I/O and network transfer of encoded audio, see the ArNetAudio library.
 * @sa ArSoundsQueue
 *
 * @note Uses an external program to play WAV files on Linux. If an environment
 * variable named PLAY_WAV is set, that program is used, otherwise, 'play' from
 * the 'sox' toolset is used.  PLAY_WAV must contain one word (the command; no arguments)
 * A call to playWavFile() will return immediately after
 * 'play' has finished, even though Linux may still be playing back the sound data. In general,
 * this kind of thing is a problem, especially with speech recognition immediately after playing
 * a sound. Ideally, we should be able to truly block until the sound has finished playback.
 * Alas, it is not an ideal world. Another potential pitfall due to the use of
 * an external program invocation: the program you call must not attempt to
 * issue any output.  'play' from the 'sox' toolset automatically supresses
 * normal output if it isn't called from an interactive terminal, but it may
 * still issue some error messages, which will cause it to hang indefinately.
 *
 * The volume (level) of audio output from a robot is determined by two things:
 * the computer sound device mixer, and also the amplifier which drives the
 * speakers.  The computer's mixer can be adjusted through the operating system:
 * on Linux, you can use the 'aumix' program to adjust the Master and PCM
 * levels.  On Windows, use the Windows mixer program.  If on Linux, ArSoundPlayer also
 * prodives the setVolume() method, which adjusts the volume of the sound before
 * it is played.
