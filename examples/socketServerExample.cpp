/** @example socketServerExample.cpp ArSocket example server program
 *
  This is an example to show how to use ArSocket. 
  a server. This is the server program. The client is socketClientExample.cpp
  
  This program opens a server on port 7777. It waits for the
  client to connect and says hello to the client. It then waits for the
  client to say hello and then exits.

  First run this server program. Then run the client program,
  socketClientExample, perhaps in a different terminal window.
  You should see the server accept the connection, send its
  greeting to the client, recieve a response from the client,
  and then the connection closes.

  This server only accepts one client connection, and then
  it exits.  In practice, most servers would loop, accepting
  many clients, and simultaneously handling curently open
  client connections.  You can use threads to do that (see
  ArASyncTask), but ArSocket is not inherently thread-safe,
  you would also need to use an ArMutex object to protect 
  ArSocket calls. 

  @see ArSocket
  @see socketClientExample.cpp

  Also see the ArNetServer to help manage a server, or the  
  ArNetworking library for a more complete networking framework.
