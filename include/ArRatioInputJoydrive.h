/// Use computer joystick to control an ArActionRatioInput and drive the robot.

/**
   This class obtains data from
   a joystick attached to the computer
   and provides it to an ArActionRatioInput which drives the robot. 
   (See ArRatioInputRobotJoydrive for a similar class that uses the robot's built in
   joystick interface.)
   A callback is attached to the ArActionRatioInput object which reads joystick
   information and sets requested drive rations on the ArActionRatioInput

   If the joystick button is pressed, then input values are set in the
   ArActionRatioDrive action object to request motion.
   If the button is not pressed, then either the robot will be stopped via the
   action (if @a stopIfNoButtonPressed is true), or no action will be requested
   and lower priority actions can take over (if @a stopIfNoButtonPressed is
   false) 
   
   You may need to calibrate the joystick for
   it to work right, for details about this see ArJoyHandler.  
   
   This class creates its own ArJoyHandler object to get input from the
   joystick, or uses the global ArJoyHandler object in the global Aria class if present.  Then it will scale the speed between 0 and the given max
   for velocity and turning, up and down on the joystick go
   forwards/backwards while right and left go right and left.  
   
   NOTE: The joystick does not save calibration information, so you
   may need to calibrate the joystick before each time you use it.  To do
   this, press the button for at least a half a second while the
   joystick is in the middle.  Then let go of the button and hold the
   joystick in the upper left for at least a half second and then in
   the lower right corner for at least a half second. See also ArJoyHandler.
