/// A point or region of interest in an Aria map.
/**
 * ArMapObject contains the data related to an Aria map object, i.e a point or
 * region of interest in an Aria map that is not part of the sensed obstacle 
 * data.  Examples of map objects include goals, docks, forbidden lines, and 
 * forbidden areas.  Applications may define their own custom ArMapObject types 
 * using the ArMap MapInfo mechanism.  See @ref ArMap for more information.
 * 
 * The basic attributes of an ArMapObject include the type of the map object,
 * an optional name of the object, and its position information.  As mentioned 
 * above, there are two basic categories of ArMapObjects:  
 *
 *  - Points:  A single ArPose in the map. By convention, if a map object
 *    can have an optional heading, then "WithHeading" appears at the end of 
 *    the object type when the heading is specified.  For example, "Goal" 
 *    designates an (x,y) location in the map (any heading or theta value should
 *    be ignored) and "GoalWithHeading" designates
 *    an (x,y,th) location.
 *
 *  - Regions: A set of two ArPoses ("from" and "to") which define a rectangle
 *    or a line.  Rectangles may have an associated rotation value. It is the
 *    rotation to be applied to the "from" and "to" poses <em> around
 *    the global origin </em>.  To retrieve the list of line segments that 
 *    comprise the rotated rectangle's perimeter, use the getFromToSegments()
 *    method.
 * 
 * Note that the ArMapObject is generally immutable.  If an object needs to be 
 * changed, then the original version should simply be replaced with a new one.  
 * See ArMap::getMapObjects(), ArMap::setMapObjects(), and ArMap::mapChanged().
 *
