#  Shows how to add a task callback to ArRobot's synchronization/processing cycle
#
#  This program will just have the robot wander around, it uses some aance 
#  routines, then just has a constant velocity.  A sensor interpretation task callback is invoked
#  by the ArRobot object every cycle as it runs, which records the robot's current 
#  pose and velocity.
#
#  Note that tasks must take a small amount of time to execute, to adelaying the
#  robot cycle.
#
#  Callbacks are done differently in Python than in C++.  In the Aria C++
#  library, a class called ArFunctor is used to store 
#  a function pointer, and an instance of an object.  Different ArFunctor
#  subclasses are used for functions with different arguments, and for global
#  functions which are not object methods.  Instead, in the Python wrapper, you
#  can simply pass a function (whether defined globally, or bound to an object
#  if defined as a method, or created on the fly as a 'lambda' expression)
#  whenever the Aria API calls for an ArFunctor*.  The most common use is shown
#  below:  a method bound to an object is passed directly as a sensor interpretation
#  task.

  # Constructor. Adds a sensor interpretation task to the given robot object.
