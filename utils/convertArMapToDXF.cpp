#include "Aria.h"

/* This program puts the LINES from an ArMap into a very minimal DXF file.  

   Usage: 
      ./convertArMapToDXF [-h|--help] [mapfile] [outputfile]
   [mapfile] and [outputfile] are optional. If omitted, then stdin and stdout 
   are used instead.
   

   TODO:  

    * Include Points from the ArMap on a separate layer
    * Include Goals and other map objects on separate layers with labels and
      appropriate metadata
    * Set useful properties in the DXF headers and layer sections.

      -> If you would like to contribute any improvements, send them to the
         ARIA users forum or support@mobilerobots.com. <-

  Output was tested in Autodesk DWG TrueView 2013.
