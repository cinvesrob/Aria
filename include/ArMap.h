/*

 * 
 *
 * Aria maps are implemented by a collection of classes and interfaces.  The 
 * most important is the ArMapInterface, which is defined in ArMapInterface.h
 * and specifies the methods that all Aria maps must provide.  
 * 
 * This file contains the top-level concrete implementation of the 
 * ArMapInterface.  ArMap is basically the map that is used by the robot 
 * to navigate its environment.  In addition to implementing the methods of 
 * ArMapInterface, ArMap also provides a means of hooking into the Aria config.  
 * When the map file name is specified in the Aria config and is changed during 
 * runtime, ArMap loads the new file and notifies all listeners that the map 
 * has been changed.
 * 
 * In order to accomplish this, ArMap has been implemented using the Proxy 
 * design pattern (refer to "Design Patterns", Gamma et al, 1995).  The 
 * participants are as follows:
 * 
 *   - Subject: ArMapInterface.  The common interface for both the RealSubject
 *     and the Proxy.  It is defined in ArMapInterface.h and is actually 
 *     the combination of several smaller interfaces:  ArMapScanInterface,
 *     ArMapObjectsInterface, ArMapInfoInterface, and ArMapSupplementInterface.
 * 
 *   - RealSubject: ArMapSimple.  The real object that the Proxy represents.
 *     It is defined in ArMapComponents.h, and is implemented by a set of 
 *     helper classes that are also defined in that header file. 
 *
 *   - Proxy: ArMap.  Creates and controls access to the RealSubject.  ArMap
 *     actually contains references to two ArMapSimple objects.  One is
 *     permanent and is the map object that is used by the robot.  The other
 *     is transient and is the map object that is currently being read from 
 *     a file following an Aria configuration update.  If the file is 
 *     successfully read, then the loading ArMapSimple object is copied to 
 *     the main permanent one and mapChanged notifications are sent to
 *     registered listeners.
 * 
 * The following "diagram" illustrates the basic hierarchy:
 *
 * <pre>  
 *        ArMapInterface                          , Defined in ArMapInterface.h
 *        ^ (extends)  ^ 
 *        |            |
 *        |            |
 *     ArMap +-------> ArMapSimple * +-------> ArMapScan *
 *                 (contains)        |
 *                                   +-------> ArMapObjects *
 *                                   |
 *                                   +-------> ArMapInfo *
 *                                   |
 *                                   +-------> ArMapSupplement *
 *
 *                                              * : Defined in ArMapComponents.h
 * </pre>
 * 
 *
 * This header file originally also contained the definition of ArMapObject.  
 * That class has been moved into its own header file (ArMapObject.h).
 * 
 *
 * Maintenance Note #1: In this case, the use of the Proxy design pattern implies 
 * that modifying the ArMap external interface requires multiple changes:  
 * First, the ArMapInterface (or sub-interface) must be updated.  Then the ArMap 
 * and ArMapSimple classes must be modified.  Depending on the change, one of the
 * helper map components may also need to be modified.  It is expected that 
 * such changes to the interface will be infrequent.

/// A map of a two-dimensional space the robot can navigate within, and which can be updated via the Aria config
/**
* ArMap contains data that represents the operating space of the robot, and can
* be used for space searching, localizing, navigating etc.  MobileRobots' ARNL
* and SONARNL localization and navigation libraries use ArMap objects.
* ArMap also provides methods to read and write the map from and to a file,
* along with a mechanism for setting the map file via the global Aria config.
* 
* Types of data stored in a map include sensable obstacles (e.g. walls and 
* furniture in a room) that are represented either as a collection of data 
* points or lines.  The data points are similar to a raster or bit map and 
* are useful for high resolution sensors like lasers.  The lines create a 
* vector map that is useful for low resolution sensors like sonar.  For 
* advanced applications, the sensable obstacle data can be categorized according
* to the type of scan or sensor; see ArMapScanInterface for more information.
* 
* In addition to the obstacle data, the Aria map may contain goals, forbidden
* areas, and other points and regions of interest (a.k.a. "map objects").  
* Advanced applications can extend the set of predefined map object types.
* See @ref MapObjects for more information.
*
* If the application needs to be aware of any changes that are made to the 
* Aria map at runtime, then it should install "mapChanged" callbacks on the map.
* If the map file is re-read while the robot is running, then the callbacks 
* are automatically invoked.  If the application makes other changes to the 
* map by calling any of the set methods, then it should call mapChanged() when
* it is finished.
* 
* See @ref MapFileFormat for the exact format of the actual .map file.
* 
* @section MapThreading Thread issuses, and changing the map
* 
* Different threads will need to access the same map data (for example ARNL, 
* ArForbiddenRangeDevice, networking). However, the ArMap class is not 
* inherently thread-safe.  You must call lock() and  unlock() methods, before 
* and after any access to the map data (e.g. calls to getMapObjects(), 
* getPoints(), setMapObjects(), setPoints()).  
* 
* If you are going to use setMapObjects(), setPoints(), setLines(), or
* setMapInfo(), then you should lock() the map beforehand, call the methods,
* then call mapChanged() to invoke the callbacks, and then finally 
* unlock() the map when done.  Note that mapChanged() will only invoke
* the callbacks if the data has actually changed.
* 
* However, there is an exception: the readFile() and writeFile() 
* methods @b do automatically lock the map while they read and write.
* 
* @section MapObjects Map Objects
* 
* In addition to lines and points, maps may contain "map objects", points
* or regions in space that have special meaning. 
*
* Certain types of objects are predefined for all maps.  These include
* Goal, GoalWithHeading, Dock, ForbiddenLine, ForbiddenArea, and RobotHome.  
* 
*  - Goal and GoalWithHeading are basically named ArPoses, the difference being
*    that the "th" (heading) value is only valid for GoalWithHeading.
*  - Dock is an ArPose that must always have a heading.
*  - ForbiddenLine is a boundary line, and ForbiddenArea is a rectangular
*    "sector". The extents of these objects are given as a pair of 
*    poses, a "from" point and a "to" point.
*  - RobotHome may be either an ArPose or a rectangular sector.
* 
* Rectangular objects may also have an associated angle of rotation, which is 
* stored in the object pose theta value (ArMapObject::getPose().getTh()).
* The actual global coordinates of the rectangle must be calculated
* using this angle and its "from-to" values. You can get a list of the 4
* ArLineSegment objects that comprise the rectangle's edges using
* ArMapObject::getFromToSegments(). If you want to do your own calculations,
* see ArMapObject::ArMapObject().
*
* You can get a pointer to the current list of map objects with getMapObjects(),
* and directly modify the list.  You can also replace the current list of 
* map objects with a new one by calling setMapObjects(); this will destroy 
* the old list of map objects.  Call mapChanged() to notify other components 
* that the map has changed.
*
* In addition to the standard map object types,  is also possible to define 
* custom types of map objects using the "MapInfo" metadata section of the
* map file.  For example, if you wished to program some special behavior that 
* would only occur upon reaching certain goals, you could define a new 
* "SpecialGoal" type in the map file, and check for it in your program.  
* See @ref MapFileFormat for the syntax for defining new object types in the 
* map file.  Custom types will appear in Mapper3 and MobilePlanner in 
* drop-down menus, and instances of the custom types will be displayed in
* MobileEyes.  
*
* <i>Important Note</i>: if a map defines special GoalType or DockType items, 
* then it must define <b>all</b> possible goal or dock types, including the 
* default "Goal", "GoalWithHeading", and "Dock" types if you want those
* types to remain available.
