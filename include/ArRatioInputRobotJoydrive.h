/**
   This class connects the joystick data obtained from  the robot's built
   in joystick port (if it has one, not all robots have a joystick port)
   to an ArActionRatioInput which drives the robot. (See ArRatioInputJoydrive
   for a similar class that uses a joystick plugged in to the computer.)

   A callback is attached to the ArActionRatioInput object which reads joystick
   information using an ArRobotJoyHandler object, and sets requested drive rations on the ArActionRatioInput
   object.
