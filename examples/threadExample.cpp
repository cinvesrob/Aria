/** @example threadExample.cpp Example showing ARIA's cross-platform threading tools.
 *
 *  ARIA provides some tools for writing multithreaded programs. These are
 *  abstractions of the threading library provided by the native operating
 *  system.
 *
 *  The three main tools are: 
 *  <ul>
 *    <li>ArASyncTask a class which can run a method in a new thread</li>
 *    <li>ArMutex, an object that can be shared by multiple threads to provide
 *        mutual exclusion from other shared data.</li>
 *    <li>ArCondition, an object that can cause a thread to block
 *        execution until signaled by another thread to continue.</li>
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  This example program shows the use of all three, with two threads
 *  interacting: the program's main thread of execution, and a new thread
 *  created using ArASyncTask.  An ArMutex object is used to keep use of
 *  some shared data safe, and then the use of ArCondition is shown.
 *
 *  Threading can be error-prone, since any (perhaps subconcious) assumptions
 *  you have about the linear execution of code may not apply to simultaneous threads.
 *  Furthermore, different computers will execute multithreaded code in
 *  different ways (especially if they have different numbers of CPUs).
 *  ARIA's threading tools can help make multiple threads work, and help make
 *  multithreaded code portable, but you must always think carefully about
 *  how code might execute (including error conditions!) to avoid deadlocks and
 *  race conditions.
