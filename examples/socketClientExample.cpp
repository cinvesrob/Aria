/** @example socketClientExample.cpp ArSocket example client program
 *
 *
  This is an example to show how to use ArSocket to create a client and 
  a server. This  is the client program.  The server is
  socketServerExample.cpp.  
  
  This connects to a server on the host 'localhost' on port 7777. It waits for the server
  to say hello, then it says hello in reponse. It then closes the socket and
  exits.

  First run the server program socketServerExample. Then run
  this client program on the same computer, perhaps in a different
  terminal window. You should see the server accept the connection,
  send its greeting to this client program, and see this client
  respond with its greeting text to the server.

  @see ArSocket
  @see socketServerExample.cpp

  Also see the ArNetworking library for a more complete
  networking framework.
